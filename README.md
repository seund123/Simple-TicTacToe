# Simple-TicTacToe
I've created a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. It starts by having the player input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and then it randomly generates a choice for the computer. After displaying the computer's move, the code determines the winner based on the game's rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both the player and computer make the same choice, it's a tie. I also included a basic input validation to ensure the player enters a valid move. It's a fun and straightforward game, and you can further enhance it by adding more features and improving the user interface.
